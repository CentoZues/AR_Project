					<h2>Narrator:</h2>
					<p>Hopefully, you can now see the Guildhall.</p>
					<p>This really was a hive of activity – they held special tribunal sessions here throughout the war to consider appeals by people who wanted to claim exemption from conscription from war service. Sometimes employers would appeal for their employees to be able to stay at work, especially those with special skills </p>
					With many fathers away in the war, some mothers found life and control of their children difficult. They held Children’s Courts here at the Guildhall. Children who committed crimes such as theft could be sent away to <p>reformatory schools or could be sentenced to receive “five strokes of the birch”. Imagine how those children would feel in court, being told off and knowing that they were going to get 5 strokes of the birch!</p>
					<p>Have a look round and I’ll meet you again between the Guildhall and the Eden Centre</p>
