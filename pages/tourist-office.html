            <h2>Background Notes</h2>
             <p>Where the tourist office and Eden Centre are now was dense housing at the turn of the twentieth century.  The whole area was known as Newlands.  On a plan of the Eden Shopping centre today, some of the names of the old streets have been preserved.  Our soldier, John, could have attended school in Priory Road. He could have attended church and Sunday school at St John’s which was a relatively new mission church at that time to cope with the population explosion in that area.  The church building was never completed – the architect intended it to have a tower!</p>
 
<p>Although strictly OFF our trail, there is an article in the Summer 2015 HWS newsletter which could be referenced for deeper click-through IF desired.  Pictures abound on SWOP of the Newlands slum area too, mostly taken later though.
