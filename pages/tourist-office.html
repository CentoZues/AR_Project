					 <h2>Background Notes</h2>
					 <p>Where the tourist office and Eden Centre are now was dense housing at the turn of the twentieth century.  The whole area was known as Newlands.  On a plan of the Eden Shopping centre today, some of the names of the old streets have been preserved.  Our soldier, John, could have attended school in Priory Road. He could have attended church and Sunday school at St John’s which was a relatively new mission church at that time to cope with the population explosion in that area.  The church building was never completed – the architect intended it to have a tower!</p>
					<p>You can find further information on territorials and reservists <a href="http://www.1914-1918.net/reserve.htm" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

					<h2>Narrator:</h2>
					<p>Hello and welcome!<br>
					I suppose I should start by introducing myself! I’m John and I’m here to guide you on your tour around my home town, High Wycombe. I was born not far from this spot in 1897, the year of Queen Victoria’s diamond jubilee. Mother used to say the flags were out and the whole town was celebrating but she was stuck at home with me.</p>
					<p>The town was well known for producing furniture and there were plenty of factories here in the 1900s, but you might not know so much about life here during the Great War.</p>
					<p>When war broke out in 1914, I wasn’t keen to sign up right away.  Some of my friends were already in the Territorials – they were at their summer camp when they got their first marching orders early in the morning.  Of course, the reservists were soon off to join their regiments, too. I stayed behind, resisting the first calls to action, but not for long.  The army recruitment officer promised adventure, so I joined the Ox and Bucks Light Infantry as did many from round here.</p>
					<p>Today I am going to tell you about what life was like in High Wycombe during the Great War. The town was busy with soldiers and their horses coming and going. Over 5000 local men went off to fight in the war.</p>
					<p>It’s difficult to get my bearings in this part of the town now, so much has changed but if we can find the railway viaduct that will help. Let’s head along here to the right until we can clearly see the viaduct and Frogmoor.</p>
