					 <h2>Background Notes</h2>
					 <p>The King during WW1 was George V</p>
					<p>Frederick Youens was born in High Wycombe, the son of basket maker Vincent Youens and Elizabeth (nee Russell). He won a scholarship to the Royal Grammar School and went on to work as a school master in Rochester, Kent, before the outbreak of war.</p>
					<p>He enlisted in August 1914 and was wounded in the Battle of Loos in 1915. He returned to the front, and, in July 1917, whilst at Ypres, was wounded by an enemy bomb which exploded as he was trying to throw it away from his men. He later succumbed to his injuries. For this action, which saved several of his men’s lives, he was awarded the VC. The 100th anniversary of his death was commemorated with the laying of a paving stone at the war memorial at All Saints Church in High Wycombe town centre. Further memorials can be seen inside the church and also at St Andrews in Hatter Lane.</p>

					<h2>Narrator:</h2>
					<p>With so many not returning after the war, families needed somewhere to go at home to remember the fallen.  You’ll see memorials like this all over the country. In 1919 The King started the national tradition of holding a two minute silence at 11 o’clock on Armistice day, 11th November – the anniversary of the end of the Great War.  A few years’ later the first silk poppies were made as a symbol of commemoration.  They became a part of an annual tradition including the laying of wreaths to the fallen.</p>
					<p>One local man, Frederick Youens earned the highest award for bravery: the Victoria Cross. Can you find the commemorative stone that bears his name?</p>
					<p>There are several individual memorials inside the Parish Church of All Saints and if the church is open go inside and have a look around.</p>
					<p>Once you have seen everything here, we are going to have a look at a very important building - the Guildhall
					</p>
