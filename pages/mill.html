					 <h2>Background Notes</h2>
					 <p>Details of flying demonstration by Captain Hucks can be found in the book "High Wycombe's Contribution to Aviation" by David Scott and Ian Simmons. The visit had been arranged by Mr Holt Thomas.
					<p>The Wycombe furniture factories were also making the furniture required for furnishing army barracks etc.  So they needed a workforce capable of meeting this demand. Requests for exemption for their employees (particularly for skilled men who could oversee the process) were made throughout the war and their arguments were heard at regular tribunals or hearings. Many chair makers left the town to work on aircraft manufacture nearer to London.  This drained the local workforce of much needed labour so that not only could the Wycombe factories not complete orders of a domestic nature (risking orders going abroad) but they couldn't complete the orders requested by the military - for furniture, munitions boxes, gas rattles etc.</p>
					<p>The Volunteer Training Corps was the Great War equivalent of the Home Guard (or Dad’s Army).  Once conscription came in, others were directed to join this.

					<h2>Narrator:</h2>
					<p>The Rye hasn’t changed much – it was waterlogged for a lot of the time in the war and not quite as flat as it seems now.  The houses that you can see all along the London Road, many of them are quite <p>huge - well they got used for all sorts of things during the war. One house, up at the far end of the Rye was the headquarters of the Wycombe Aircraft Construction company.</p>
					<p>A lot of the chair factories were just up behind the houses.  Some of them changed to making munitions and other war supplies. But, towards the end of the war, they started making airplane parts. It made sense to use the skills of the chairmakers as the airplanes were all made of wood.  There was great excitement one day in April 1918 when Captain Hucks gave a flying demonstration in his DH9 airplane – he flew right over the town! Remember Mr Cox, the tobacconist and hairdresser? He was one of the lucky people given a chance of a seat for a flight.</p>
					<p>This chap looks like he worked in one of the factories, let’s hear what he has to say …</p>
					<h2>CHARACTER - factory worker.</h2>
					<p>Well, I suppose I was lucky I didn’t have to go to war.  I would have joined the army soon enough but I failed the medical examination.  Couldn’t breathe well enough, they said.  Well, a lot of us in the factory had problems with our lungs what with all the sawdust we were breathing in every day not to mention the varnishes and paint.  I joined the local Volunteer Training Corps just the same so I would have done my bit if there had been an invasion.  Later on in the war, when conscription came into force, it didn’t seem to matter any longer that I wasn’t fit, I had to register and I got papers calling me up but my boss went off to the tribunal and argued that he needed me.  We were already doing war work by then and he got my enrolment delayed for a few months, just long enough for him to find a substitute, they said.  Then the factory started making airplane parts and now my skills are needed.  I think I’ll be at home for the rest of the war.</p>
					<p>Cross the road and head back in to the town to meet your soldier friend</p>
