					 <h2>Background Notes</h2>
					 <p>During WW1, Arthur Clarke lived in the house which is now home to the museum. Arthur was the Town Clerk, and he and his wife were heavily involved in the establishment and fundraising for the new War Memorial Hospital. They lost their eldest son Donald who served in the Royal Flying Corps.
You can find out more information about graves in Wycombe Cemetery from the website ‘<a href="http://www.galaxypix.com/Sally/Losttheplot/Tellthemofus/" target="_blank">Tell Them of Us</a>’</p>

					<h2>Narrator:</h2>
					<p>Here we are at the end of the trail. It’s been quite a journey and I can see that Wycombe has changed a lot since I was last here. It’s time for me to leave you now - well done for completing the trail, enjoy a cup of tea at the museum. If interested, you can walk up the hill to the site of the VAD hospital and have a walk around the cemetery to see the graves of some of my comrades.  Miss Christie’s grave is there too overlooking the school buildings to which she would have liked to have returned.</p>
