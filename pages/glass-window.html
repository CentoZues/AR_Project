					 <h2>Background Notes</h2>
					 <p><a href="http://ww1facts.net/people/conscription/" target="_blank">Conscription</a> refers to the process of automatically calling up men (and later, women) for military service. During the WW1 men who were conscripted into the armed forces had no choice but to go and fight, even if they did not want to. WW1 conscription ended in 1919</p>

					<p>During WW1, Britain depended on cargo ships to import food and raw materials, as well as to transport soldiers overseas, and keep them supplied. After the war, King George V granted the title '<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/0/ww1/26280177" target="_blank">Merchant Navy</a>' to recognise the contribution made by merchant sailors. Britain's merchant fleet was the largest in the world during both world wars. By the end of the First World War, more than 3,000 British flagged merchant and fishing vessels had been sunk and nearly 15,000 merchant seamen had died.</p>
					<p>At the start of WW1, Britain had the biggest navy in the world. The Royal Navy had hundreds of ships and more than 200,000 sailors. The Navy played an important role during World War One. It protected the British Isles and its colonies and was also used to blockade the ports of enemy countries to try and stop supplies of food and other materials getting in. The Royal Navy Air Service started in 1914 and the first specially-built aircraft carrier HMS Argus was launched in 1918.</p>

					<p>“five strokes of the birch” - A birch rod is a bundle of leafless twigs bound together to form an implement for administering corporal punishment. He birch would typically be applied to the recipient's bare buttocks, although occasionally to the back and/or shoulders.</p>

					<p>Children’s Courts and Tribunals were regularly reported in the local papers.</p>
					<p>One tribunal case concerns an appeal that the “porter at the Saunderton workhouse should be exempt from war service”. One of his tasks was to bath vagrants and it was said that the vagrants would not be bathed if he went to war!  The Saunderton workhouse served the whole of the Wycombe Union district which was approximately the same as Wycombe District today.  For most of the war there were approx. 200 inmates.  If any of them appeared eligible for military service they would be referred to the recruiting office, so it tended to be the sick and old who remained.  Towards the end of 1917 the workhouse was taken over by the military and the inmates transferred to other places.  It never reopened after the war.</p>
					<p>The Guildhall was also where the Board of Guardians met.  They managed the Workhouse at Saunderton and the Poor Law School at Bledlow. Some of these were pacifists but mostly they were people who were needed at home or at work either to look after elderly relatives or to keep businesses going. </p>
					<p>The Guildhall window was made up in London in the studios of the late Arthur Dix.  The same studio did the windows in the Red Room (now called Oak Room) in the town hall in 1911 when Arthur Dix was still alive. The Territorials formed the Bucks Battalion -their symbol is up the top right, and you can see the Red Cross symbol bottom left.  Charles Raffety was a thoughtful man who tried to remember everyone.</p>
					<p>Towards the end of the war, Mr Raffety was one of the few people who realised how hard men and women had been working in the Postal services so he threw a big party for them all.  He tried to do it anonymously but word got out.

					<h2>Narrator:</h2>
					<p>Now look up at the Guildhall – you’ll need to have your back to the Eden Centre – and you will see a stained glass window.</p>
					<p>This doesn’t look wonderful from the outside in daytime but it is a very special Memorial which honours all the local servicemen who went away to war and returned alive.  It was Charles Raffety’s idea.  He was an elderly man – some called him the Grand Old Man of High Wycombe – he was always doing things for the town! Anyway, this window isn’t just for those who were in the army – it also includes the Navy and Merchant Navy– and there are lots of other details.  My regiment’s badge is up there near the top left: see the bugle of the Ox and Bucks - but it’s only one of many that local people served in.</p>
					<p>One family in Wycombe had all 8 sons return from the war. They received a letter from the King thanking the boys for their efforts – quite amazing as so many families lost all their men.</p>
					<p>Follow the road round the corner in front of the Swan Theatre. Follow the river past the Police Station and cross Queen Victoria Road.</p>
					<p>Before you cross Queen Victoria Road imagine what it would have looked like with soldiers and horses instead of cars.</p>
