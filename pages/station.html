<p>The big train shed below the station served the Marlow and Maidenhead line branch and was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel as part of the Great Western Railway and was the original 1854 train station before it was replaced ten years later. The old building then became the ticket office and an engine workshop. The line from Wycombe to Marylebone was added to the rail service in 1902.

					<h2>Narrator:</h2>
					<p>All of us soldiers will have lasting memories of the station.  It was the place we all said our farewells when we left to go to training camp and also the place that those of us lucky enough to return would be welcomed back.  On occasions, it was also the place where there would be a guard of honour for a funeral procession for one of our number who was not so lucky.  This was a hive of activity in my day, with the goods yards, the horses and the livestock.  The army recruitment office was just opposite – you can see it on an old photo.   And just up the road was the vicarage for Christ Church –it was a nice little church on the steep bit of the hill you’ve just come up.  No sign of it now.  They had an orchestra and their organist was Ivor Gurney, the poet and composer.</p>
<h2>CHARACTER - Wycombe High School girl: </h2>
<p>A lot of children have fathers and brothers away on war service so normal family life is a thing of the past.  Travelling has become quite difficult so many of us are boarding in hostels about town – I was boarding with Miss Christie who was an excellent teacher and headmistress. She chose our school motto: Fortiter, Fideliter, Feliciter – Bravely, Faithfully, Happily- and she encouraged us to remember it in all that we did. She would go out sometimes to suffragist meetings.  We weren’t supposed to know where she was going but I asked her once and she said she hoped we would all get the vote one day.</p>
<p>She worked so very hard for us all that it seems so unfair that she died so suddenly in 1917 after an asthma attack. It seemed everyone in the town knew her and loved her.  </p>
<h2>Transition:</h2>
<p>Our journey is nearly over. Go over the railway bridge and turn left and you will find the museum on the right
