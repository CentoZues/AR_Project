            <p>
            The fountain used to be a rallying point - for prayers and church parades, for union meetings and demonstrations, or just meeting up.  The preacher, John Wesley, came here at 5.30am which inspired Hannah Ball to found the first Sunday School. The suffragettes came here before the war too, attracting large crowds who did not always behave themselves, throwing eggs and rotten tomatoes at the women.
                Although there were many active suffragists in High Wycombe, there was not the same support for the suffragettes who advocated breaking the law to achieve their ends.  There were also active anti-suffragist supporters in the area.  Our narrator who was a teenager is likely to remember the hostile reception which the suffragettes received</p>
 
<p>The Citadel replaced Frogmore House which was one of the buildings used by Wycombe High School before they moved to Benjamin Road. It was built in 1909
Soldiers stationed in town who did not want to swim or visit the theatre, could visit the Church of England Menâ€™s Society (CEMS) rooms where they could go to hang out, play whist or write letters home. CEMS began in York and spread all over the country.  Male members of the Church of England could join on payment of a small subscription.  They undertook to pray daily and to do something to help forward the work of the church.  In High Wycombe during the war they regularly advertised their whist drives for soldiers and the availability of quiet rooms upstairs.
Towards the end of the war there was a food distribution point here too for meals cooked in the National Kitchen. The premises of the Argentine Meat Company, right alongside the Electroscope, were used. It was more economical to cook in big quantities and then distribute the meals ready-cooked so they were cooked each morning and brought here for distribution. The National Kitchen scheme provided a kind of forerunner of ready-meals.
