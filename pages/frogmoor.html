					 <h2>Background Notes</h2>
					 <p>The fountain used to be a rallying point - for prayers and church parades, for union meetings and demonstrations, or just meeting up.  The preacher, John Wesley, came here at 5.30am which inspired Hannah Ball to found the first Sunday School. The suffragettes came here before the war too, attracting large crowds who did not always behave themselves, throwing eggs and rotten tomatoes at the women.</p>

					<p>Although there were many active suffragists in High Wycombe, there was not the same support for the suffragettes who advocated breaking the law to achieve their ends.  There were also active anti-suffragist supporters in the area.  Our narrator who was a teenager is likely to remember the hostile reception which the suffragettes received.</p>
					<p>The Citadel replaced Frogmore House which was one of the buildings used by Wycombe High School before they moved to Benjamin Road. It was built in 1909</p>
					<p>Soldiers stationed in town who did not want to swim or visit the theatre, could visit the Church of England Men’s Society (CEMS) rooms where they could go to hang out, play whist or write letters home. CEMS began in York and spread all over the country.  Male members of the Church of England could join on payment of a small subscription.  They undertook to pray daily and to do something to help forward the work of the church.  In High Wycombe during the war they regularly advertised their whist drives for soldiers and the availability of quiet rooms upstairs.</p>
					<p>Towards the end of the war there was a food distribution point here too for meals cooked in the National Kitchen. The premises of the Argentine Meat Company, right alongside the Electroscope, were used. It was more economical to cook in big quantities and then distribute the meals ready-cooked so they were cooked each morning and brought here for distribution. The National Kitchen scheme provided a kind of forerunner of ready-meals.</p>
					<p>Jacob Popp was the subject of many articles and news items. This <a href="http://postcardcollecting.co.uk/ppm_online/ppm_09_dec.pdf" target="_blank">link</a> gives further information about him</p>
					<p>The Technical and Arts School later became the <a href="http://www.jhgs.bucks.sch.uk/123/history" target="_blank">John Hampden Grammar School</a> </p>
					<p>The school set up a scheme to train disabled war veterans to give them a future career after being deemed unfit to be part of the army. The school still has a set of lockers made by war veterans.</p>

					<h2>Narrator:</h2>
					<p>
					So, this is Frogmoor – or Frogmoor Gardens as it was known in my time!  There weren’t many cars around back then, more horses and carts.  I can see a few old buildings are still here, but where’s the fountain?  So many streets and buildings have changed since I was last here: I remember the Gardens busy with troops, here to make the most of some time off.</p>
					<p>
					The building over by the viaduct with the clock tower - that used to be the Technical and Arts School, but before the Great War started part of it had already become the public swimming baths, quite a change! Soldiers were allocated a time when their regiment could use the baths and it was very popular!
					Over here on the Oxford Road side, you would have seen the Electroscope theatre with its 900 seats. Can you imagine this place with hardly any cars, the fountain and 100s of troops enjoying their leisure time?</p><p>
					Whilst we are here, can you see the sign for Mr Popp’s shop – it’s up on the wall where his shop was.
					Jacob Popp was quite a local character. He had many run-ins with the authorities as he wanted to open his shop on Sundays which, in those days, was not allowed! He paid many fines and once, rather cheekily, asked if he could go in the town stocks rather than pay his fine! When the war started in 1914, we were all surprised when Popp became a Special Constable – Section Sergeant of the Central Section, no less, responsible for Law and Order in this area!</p>
					<p>
					If we walk down Church Street towards the Church, we can already see our next destination.</p>
