					 <h2>Background Notes</h2>
					 <p>The Voluntary Aid Detachment system was founded in 1909 with the help of the Red Cross and Order of St. John. By the summer of 1914 there were over 2,500 VADS in Britain. Of the 74,000 VAD members in 1914, two-thirds were women and girls.</p>
<p>At the outbreak of the First World War VAD members offered their service to the war effort. The British Red Cross was reluctant to allow civilian women a role in overseas hospitals: most volunteers were of the middle and upper classes and unaccustomed to hardship and traditional hospital discipline. Military authorities would not accept VADs at the front line.
However, the growing shortage of trained nurses opened the door for VADs in overseas military hospitals and female volunteers over the age of twenty-three and with more than three months' hospital experience were accepted for overseas service.</p><p>
By 1916 the military hospitals at home were employing about 8000 trained nurses with about 126,000 beds, and there were 4000 nurses abroad with 93,000 beds. By 1918 there were about 80,000 VAD members - 12,000 nurses working in the military hospitals and 60,000 unpaid volunteers working in auxiliary hospitals or various </p><p>
VADs lacked the advanced skill and discipline of trained professional nurses, and were often critical of the nursing profession. Relations improved as the war stretched on: VAD members increased their skill and efficiency and trained nurses were more accepting of the VADs' contributions. During four years of war 38,000 VADs worked in hospitals and served as ambulance drivers and cooks. VADs served near the Western Front and in Mesopotamia and Gallipoli. VAD hospitals were also opened in most large towns in Britain. Later, VADs were also sent to the Eastern Front. They provided an invaluable source of bedside aid in the war effort. Many were decorated for distinguished service.</p><p>
At the end of the war the leaders of the profession were agreed that untrained VADs should not be allowed onto the newly established register of nurses.
The RGS building in Easton Street was designed by Arthur Vernon, a well-known local architect and built in 1882. The plan was originally to demolish the buildings at the front completely, but a group of historians and conservationists of the day were up in arms about it and insisted on the ancient parts being preserved.</p>

					<p>So, this building was a Boys’ school at the start of the war – The Royal Grammar School, no less. 325 RGS Old Boys and Masters served in the forces during the Great War. 39 lost their lives. </p>
					<p>Despite the war, new school buildings were completed on top of Amersham Hill and the boys moved up the hill in 1915. This building would not remain vacant for very long but the next occupants would be girls. We heard about the Wycombe Abbey girls earlier. What else did local girls get up to during the war? Let’s hear from one of the Wycombe High School pupils….</p>
					<h2>CHARACTER - Wycombe High School girl</h2>
					<p>We are lucky to have this building.  Soon after the war started, our school buildings in Benjamin Road were requisitioned for temporary use as a VAD hospital. Everything was done in a hurry. Our headmistress, Miss Christie, was given 24 hours notice to vacate the premises and we all had to help carry books and equipment to two houses on the London Road:  Oxcroft House and Bedford House. It was chaotic.</p>
					<p>A year later, when our buildings were again needed as a VAD hospital, we moved here, into the old Grammar School building. Many of us now help out at the VAD hospital. We do six-hour shifts and our school hours have been adjusted so we can do this.  It’s nice to see some of the patients getting better.  We have even had a couple of exciting hockey matches in the cricket club grounds in February 1917.  Other pupils help with growing vegetables and maintaining the gardens of those who have gone to war.</p>

					<p>Now we are heading for the station. Look out as you go along for the old post office – above the door you’ll see the Royal Crest with the lion and the unicorn. Keep walking and turn right up Crendon Street. As you go up Crendon Street, try to imagine a narrow lane – the horses used to find the going really tough on that hill.  The Soldiers’ club was somewhere here on Crendon Street but there’s nothing left now. A lot of local women were involved in the war effort here, helping with eh Belgian Refugee Workroom and Prisoners of War Clothing Committee</p>
