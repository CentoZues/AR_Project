					 <h2>Background Notes</h2>
					 <p>On the same day that Lord Carrington gave the land to the town, Major Coningsby Disraeli formally handed Rye Mead “back” to the town, too. There were some who said it should always have belonged to the town as it had been common pasture land for the burgesses of the borough since time immemorial.  Major Coningsby served in the Royal Bucks Hussars around the time of the Boer War but never saw service abroad.</p>

					<h2>Narrator:</h2>
					<p>Well now, this has changed a little since the war. These gates look brand new – but they’re like the old ones that used to be down at the entrance to Daws Hill Park – and it looks like they kept the old railings.</p>
					<p>A lot of this land, including the stretch of water used to be inside Daws Hill Park and was separate from the Rye.  His lordship gave the land to the Town a few years after the war in memory of his son, Viscount Wendover, who died after being mortally wounded at Ypres. That’s why the path you’re on is called Wendover Way. 
					<p>The Carringtons offered their grounds here in Daws Hill Park to be used in whatever manner the mayor saw fit to help the war effort, and with the town playing host to thousands of soldiers, there was another large military camp here.</p>
					<p>Turn around now and walk back across the Rye towards Pann Mill</p>
