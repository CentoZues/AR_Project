					 <h2>Background Notes</h2>
					 <p>At the start of the war in 1914, Lord Kitchener, the Secretary of State for War, realised that Britain needed a bigger army. By making a direct appeal to the men of Britain, he created a new volunteer army, which became known as 'Kitchener's Army'. Posters that showed him pointing his finger at passers-by with the words 'Your Country Needs You' inspired men to join up and they queued outside recruitment offices all over Britain to join the army.
					</p>
					<p>Mr Cox was the Mayor in 1911, the year of George V’s coronation.  He was very popular in the town and had a dream of making a playground for children on the Rye which he realised after the war.

					<h2>Narrator:</h2>
					<p>There are so many changes at street level, but if you keep looking up, there are still clues of what used to be here in my time and before.  See here beneath the gabled roofs, “the Hen and Chickens” written underneath rebuilt in 1888 according to the legend. If you look at the left hand side of the roof, you will see the word ‘Peace’ which was the name of the tailor business who had their shop here.</p>
					<p>Peace & Jones supplied uniforms for soldiers – let’s meet William, one of the tailors</p>
					<h2>CHARACTER - Tailor:</h2>
					<p>Hello, my name is William Peace.  I was too old to join the army when Kitchener appealed to the nation.  The maximum age was 38 and I was already 49. I may not have gone to fight in the war, with all the other fit and ready men, but I’m still proudly serving my country.  Business has never been this good; I’ve had to call in for some extra help.  My two hands alone cannot keep up with the demand!</p>
					<h2>Narrator:</h2>
					<p>Popp and Peace weren’t the only memorable shopkeepers of that time. Also in this area was one of the shops belonging to Mr Cox, an ex-mayor of High Wycombe. He had a tobacconist shop in Church Street where local residents could buy tobacco to send out to the troops on the front line – a very welcome gift!
