					 <h2>Background Notes</h2>
					 <p>Loakes Park was the Royal Field Artillery camp – the 21st Division was one of the first created in response to Kitchener’s appeal and this was the centre of their artillery training.</p>
					<p>Viscount Wendover was a child aged 4 when he and his family moved to Daws Hill House.  The estate was divided to create the school.</p>
					<p>The first headmistress of the school, Miss Dove, was a formidable lady, a pioneer in girls’ education, and very well-known about the town, long after she retired as headmistress. Not everyone approved of her. She became a Borough Councillor and stood to become the Mayor of the town but was prevented from taking office because she was a woman. She was a suffragist and encouraged the girls to make the most of their lives.  She had to wait till long after the war before her contribution was recognised and she became a Dame.</p>
					<p>The manner in which Miss Dove was prevented from taking office as Mayor provoked debate nationally and internationally. During the war there was already a new headmistress here, Miss Whitelaw.  She was keen for the girls to have a chapel at the school, but funds could not be found so in the meantime the girls attended services at All Saints’ Parish Church in town. Gustav Holst taught at the school from 1912 to 1917 and, on Wednesday afternoons he directed the choir at the school. He was quite a recognisable figure and of course he became famous as a composer of the Planets in particular after the war. He was also teaching at other schools at that time. He changed his name to eliminate the “von” at the end of the war.</p>
					<p>Both Lady Carrington and Mrs Disraeli were honoured after the war for their contributions to the Red Cross.</p>

					<h2>Narrator:</h2>
					<p>What a lovely garden this is! Lovely to see the river – it certainly smells better than it used to! You can see the university from here and, if the leaves on the trees aren’t too green, the hospital. Behind the hospital, you might be able to see Tom Burt’s Hill. I used to climb up there often as a child and at the beginning of the war.  You get a good view of the town from the hill – you could see some of the furniture factories that Wycombe was so famous for. The hospital’s huge now!  Much bigger than in my day.</p>
					<p>In wartime looking down from the hill you’d see the barracks of course but they’d be lost in a sea of canvas, as there were army tents everywhere.</p>
					<p>Loakes Park at the bottom of the hill was the Royal Field Artillery camp and this was the centre of their artillery training.  They were billeted in High Wycombe at the start of war.  The 14th Durham Light Infantry and the 13th Rifle Brigade were also in the town.  I had thought that life at home would carry on as usual, but the whole town changed so rapidly.</p>
					<p>Wycombe Abbey School, across the road from here, used to be the home of the Carrington family. They had already moved up the hill to Daws Hill House when the school opened just before I was born. I heard that the schoolgirls were really busy during the war. Let’s meet someone who can tell us a bit more…..</p>
					<h2>CHARACTER – Lady visitor</h2>
					<p>The girls at Wycombe Abbey School do a lot for the war effort.  They have raised funds for two ambulances to help the Red Cross and now they are busy knitting lots of “mufflers, socks and helmets” for the troops in Boulogne.  They’re organising a big concert soon for the soldiers from the VAD hospitals in Cliveden and Wycombe.  The girls’ choir is really very good since their teacher and choirmaster, Gustav von Holst, works them very hard.  He composes things especially for them to sing.</p>
					<p>Of course, Lady Carrington and Mrs Disraeli both work very hard for the Red Cross too – their appeals for money for the Red Cross helped buy three motor launches – did you know that one of the motor launches has been named the Wycombe Swan because the funds were raised here. It’s now out in Mesopotamia helping save lives by ferrying the injured along the river Tigris.
					Your soldier friend is waiting for you in the park, follow this road to meet him</p>
